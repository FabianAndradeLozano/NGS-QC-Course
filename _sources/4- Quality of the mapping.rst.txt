4 Quality of the Mapping
***********************************

Introduction to Mapping and tools
==================================

Once our reads are clean and with good Quality, most of the analysis requires the aligment of this reads respect a reference genome.
Depending on the origin of our sequencing data (WGS, WES, RNA-seq, Chip-seq, ...) and the downstream analysis, several alingers are available to adjust to the necessities of our analysis. 

**Basic aligment**: Based on the Smith-Waterman algorithm, needs the creation of an index of the reference genome, used as a dictionary to query the reads.
    - BWA-MEM: by default perform local aligment, 
    - bowtie2: by default perform global aligment, is faster than BWA but less sensitive.

**RNA-seq splice-aware aligner**
    - STAR
    - TopHat 
    - HISAT2

**Pseudo-Aligner - Quasi-mapping**: very fast, map to transciptome and does quantitation. Can't find novel transcripts.
    - Salmon
    - Kallisto

Previous aligment of the reads, a reference genome in fasta format is needed, Typical sources to look up are UCSC, Ensembl or Gencode. An indexing of the reference genome is perfomed to create a dictionary database of the redundant sequences of the genome and facilitate and accelerate the query of the reads respect this regions, thus, minimizing the the memory footprint.

BAM QC 
===========================

Even if the Quality control of the reas was correct, there are some problems  with the reads that are visualized after mapping (Low coverage, homopolymers biases, experimental artifacts, etc)
Most of the tools to asses Mapping Quality relies on the values of MAPQ, which is a Phred-scaled probability that the alignment is wrong.


.. math::
    MAPQ = -10*log10(P)

Where P is the probability that the alignment is wrong.

For example, for a MAPQ value of 20 the probability that the alignment is wrong is 1 in 100 (0.01), 

.. math::
    MAPQ = -10*log10(0.01) = 20

The confidence of the alignment is higher when the MAPQ value is higher.

Main Tools to asses the quality of the mapping are:

.. note::
    The value og the MAPQ is Algorithm-specific, so the values of MAPQ are not comparable between different aligners.

**SAMStat**
------------

Is a CLI tool that offers Statistics of SAM/BAM files of unmapped, poorly and accuretly mapped raads.

    Check the SAMStat_ GitHub repository for more information about usage. 


BAM format. Note, that the BAM file has to be sorted by chromosomal coordinates. Sorting can be performed with samtools sort.

**Qualimap**
------------

Qualimap is a platform-independent application written in Java and R that provides both a GUI and a command-line interface to facilitate the quality control of alignment sequencing data. 
It can be used to assess the quality of the alignment of reads to a reference genome, the coverage of the genome, the distribution of reads across the genome and helps to detect biases.
Qualimap generates a series of plots and tables that can be used to evaluate the quality of the alignment and identify potential problems with the data. 
It can be used to assess the quality of alignments generated by a variety of alignment tools, including BWA, Bowtie, and STAR.

Requires a sorted BAM file as input and the origin data supported are WGS, WES, RNA-seq and Chip-seq. 

.. note::
    .. _Samtools: https://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools-sort.html
    BAM file sorting by chromosomal coordinates can be performed with samtools sort Samtools_.


Depending on the origin of our data, exist different modes for quality asses. 

    - BamQC: provides evaluation of the mapping quality of the reads. And if an annotation file is provided (Typically bed file of the coverage refgions by the Library prepa kit), it can also provide information about the coverage of the genes.

    - Rna-seq: specific for whole transciptome sequencing data. Can be use as a complementary tool with BamQC. 

    - Multi-sample BamQC: When working with multiple samples (i.e. sequencing data in cancer) and theese belongs to an specific group.
    This allow to detect if all the samples in an specific group pass the quality control.

    - Counts QC: When working with RNA-seq data, this mode allows to asses the differential expresion betweeen two or more experimental conditions.

**Picard Tools - RNAseqMetrics**

RNAseqMetrics is a tool from Picard Tools that provides a comprehensive set of metrics for RNA-seq data. 
It can be used to assess the quality of the alignment of reads to a reference genome, the coverage of the genome, 
the distribution of reads across the genome and helps to detect biases.

**RSeQC**: Quality control of post aligment RNA-seq data, "inspect sequence quality, nuvleotide composition, PCR duplication, GC bias.
