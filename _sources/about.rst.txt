Outline
============

This NGS Quality Control (QC) course will train participants to run FASTQC on short reads obtained with Illumina and interpret the quality control parameters offered by this tool. 

.. _home-page-learning:

Learning objectives
============

* Know the main steps of a library preparation in DNA-seq and RNA-seq, the bias introduced in each of this and solutions to avoid them 
* Learn how the main sequencing technologies works (Illumina for short reads and Nanopore for long reads). 
* Execute/Run the main quality control tools for raw data (FASTQC/NanoPlot and FASQ-Screen) obtained for short and long reads.
* Understand the FASTQ format and interpret the Quality Control report offered by theese tools.
* Aggregate the QC reports of different tools and samples with MULTIQC.
* Execute and learn about the preprocessing tools for adapter and low quality reads removal (TRIMMOMATIC, Cutadapter, Sickle, Fastp).
